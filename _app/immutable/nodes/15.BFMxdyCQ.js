in hopes that it helps others know they’re not alone.</p> <h2>The Beginning</h2> <p>When I was young, I was diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech. For those
who don’t know, CAS is a motor speech disorder where the brain struggles to tell
the mouth how to move to form words. It’s not about not knowing what to say —
it’s about the path from brain to mouth being a bit tangled.</p> <p>Speech therapy became a regular part of my life. Hours upon hours of practice,
repetition, and hard work. Some days were frustrating. Some days I wanted to
give up. But I kept going.</p> <h2>The Challenges</h2> <p>Growing up with a speech disorder can be isolating. People sometimes didn’t
understand me, or assumed things about me that weren’t true. Kids can be mean.
Adults can be impatient. It would have been easy to retreat, to stay quiet, to
let my voice remain unheard.</p> <p>But I had support — my family, my therapists, and eventually, others who
understood what I was going through. That support made all the difference.</p> <h2>Finding My Voice</h2> <p>Today, I’m a college student running Young Able Voices. I’ve given a TEDx talk.
I’ve been interviewed on podcasts and featured in articles. My voice — the very
thing that once felt like my biggest struggle — has become my greatest strength.</p> <p>That’s not to say everything is perfect. I still work on my speech. I still have
challenging days. But I’ve learned that our challenges don’t define us—how we
face them does.</p> <h2>Why I Started YAV</h2> <p>I created Young Able Voices because I wished I’d had something like it when I
was younger. A place to connect with kids who get it. A community where having a
hidden disability doesn’t make you feel alone.</p> <p>If you’re struggling right now, I want you to know: your future is bright. The
challenges you’re facing? They’re preparing you for something amazing. Keep
going.</p>`,1);function p(e){var t=i();n(24),o(e,t)}export{p as component};
