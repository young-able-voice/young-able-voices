				Young Able Voices was created to provide a safe, supportive community for children with hidden disabilities.
				We believe that no child should feel alone in their journey.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
				Hidden disabilities — invisible conditions like speech disorders, learning differences, chronic illnesses, and
				neurological conditions — can be isolating. Kids often feel misunderstood or different from their peers.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
				Through peer-to-peer support, we help children connect with others who truly understand what they're going
				through. Together, we share tips, encouragement, and friendship.
