I am the founder of Young Able Voices, a peer-to-peer support group dedicated to helping individuals with speech and communication differences build confidence and community. My commitment to inclusion has led me to host the Gender Equity Matters and Hidden Disability Summits, speak at the Apraxia Kids National Conference for four consecutive years, and present at schools and conferences nationwide.","I have delivered a TEDx talk and co-authored four research papers within the past two years. Originally adopted from Khabarovsk, Russia, I bring a global and compassionate perspective to everything I do.","Outside the classroom, I enjoy field hockey, golf, rock climbing, and recently caving, and playing floorball abroad.
